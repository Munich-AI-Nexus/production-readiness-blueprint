# Module 2: Behavior â€“ Explicit, Inspectable Planning

## Overview
This module explores planning systems, separating reasoning from execution for transparency and control.

## Goals
- Understand planner-actor separation.
- Learn techniques for debuggable, auditable decision-making.
- Design deterministic policies for complex workflows.

## Key Questions
- Why does black-box reasoning fail in production?
- How can planning be formalized and tested?
- What patterns make agent decision-making predictable?

## Topics
- Planner-actor separation
- Decision trees and policy engines
- Dynamic planning with explicit reasoning chains
- Testing and debugging strategies for planners
