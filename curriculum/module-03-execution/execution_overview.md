# Module 3: Execution – Deterministic and Reliable Operations

## Overview
This module focuses on execution as a first-class system concern: turning plans into actions that are predictable, testable, and resilient to failure.

## Goals
- Design deterministic execution workflows.
- Reduce runtime surprises through validation and isolation.
- Build execution pipelines that scale safely under real-world load.

## Key Questions
- How do we enforce predictable runtime behavior?
- Where should validation occur — and what should fail loudly?
- How do we isolate failures without corrupting system state?

## Topics
- Workflow engines and orchestration
- Schema enforcement (Pydantic, JSON Schema)
- Retry strategies, fallback paths, and error isolation
- Structured logging, execution tracing, and replayability
