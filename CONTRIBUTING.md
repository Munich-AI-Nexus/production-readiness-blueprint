# Contributing to the Production Readiness Blueprint

The **Munich AI Nexus** is a practitioner-led community building an open-source **playbook for production-grade AI systems**.  
We welcome contributions, but we follow a **centralized, review-first workflow** to ensure high-quality, anonymized content.  

---

## 🔹 Contribution Flow

1. **Start With an Issue**
   - [Open a Topic Request](../../issues/new?template=topic_request.yml) to suggest a topic, resource, or curriculum improvement.
   - [Submit a Case Study](../../issues/new?template=case_study.yml) to propose a project for review or documentation.
   - [Propose an RFC](../../issues/new) for design patterns, anti-patterns, or architectural guidance.

2. **Vote & Discuss**
   - Add 👍 reactions to Issues you want prioritized.
   - Join discussions in Issues or Slack to refine scope.

3. **Create or Join a Pull Request**
   - Link your PR to the relevant Issue (`Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER`).
   - Follow the [PR Template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
   - PRs are reviewed by **maintainers** before merging.

4. **Merge & Publish**
   - Maintainers review content for clarity, security, and anonymization.
   - Once approved, it’s merged into the Blueprint.
