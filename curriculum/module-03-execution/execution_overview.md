# Module 3: Execution – Deterministic and Reliable Operations

## Overview
This module focuses on reliable execution pipelines and failure-resistant runtime systems.

## Goals
- Design deterministic, testable workflows.
- Minimize runtime surprises with validation and error handling.
- Create execution runtimes that scale safely.

## Key Questions
- How do we enforce predictable runtime behavior?
- What’s the right level of validation and instrumentation?
- How do we handle failure modes gracefully?

## Topics
- Workflow engines and orchestration
- Schema enforcement (Pydantic, JSON Schema)
- Retry strategies, fallback paths, and error isolation
- Structured logging and execution tracing
