# Module 4: State â€“ Persistence for Resilience

## Overview
Persistent state enables resumable workflows, fine-grained debugging, and long-running processes.

## Goals
- Learn to design resilient state management systems.
- Enable reproducibility and traceability.
- Architect for distributed and long-lived workflows.

## Key Questions
- How do we capture state without excessive complexity?
- What are common pitfalls in session and memory management?
- How do we version workflows for safety and compliance?

## Topics
- Checkpointing and version control for workflows
- Distributed state stores and consistency trade-offs
- Replayable workflows and rollback strategies
- State design for agent memory and context windows
