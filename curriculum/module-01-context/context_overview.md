# Module 1: Context – From Data Chaos to Clarity

## Overview
This module focuses on transforming raw, fragmented data into structured, trustworthy context for AI systems.

## Goals
- Learn how to design a contextual foundation for reasoning systems.
- Apply RAG, schema design, and ontology principles.
- Build strategies for long-term data governance.

## Key Questions
- How do we prevent “garbage in, garbage out” at scale?
- What does a robust context store architecture look like?
- How do we evaluate and iterate on context quality?

## Topics
- Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns
- Knowledge graphs and ontology design
- Data contracts and schema versioning
- Data evaluation metrics and governance strategies

## Related Layers
- CAA Layer: Context
- Cross-Cutting: Observability (for data quality metrics)
