# Curriculum – The Production Readiness Blueprint

The **Production Readiness Blueprint** is the structured curriculum of the Munich AI Nexus.  
It is based on the [Cognitive Agent Architecture (CAA)](https://github.com/cognitive-agentic-architecture), a reference model authored prior to the Nexus, and refined here through **case studies, RFCs, and practitioner debate**.

---

## 🔹 Why This Curriculum Exists
Most AI pilots fail to reach production.  
CAA provides the **architectural backbone**: six layers plus cross-cutting concerns that make AI systems **auditable, controllable, and extensible**.  

This curriculum extends CAA into a **practical, evolving playbook**:  
- Each module corresponds to a CAA layer (or extension).  
- Content is drawn from **live Nexus sessions**, **submitted case studies**, and **RFCs**.  
- The Blueprint grows over time, session by session, as the community contributes.

## 🔹 The Modules

### Core CAA Layers
1. [Context – From Data Chaos to Clarity](./module-01-context/context_overview.md)  
2. [Behavior – Explicit, Inspectable Planning](./module-02-behavior/behavior_overview.md)  
3. [Execution – Deterministic and Reliable Operations](./module-03-execution/execution_overview.md)  
4. [State – Persistence for Resilience](./module-04-state/state_overview.md)  
5. [Collaboration – Human Oversight by Design](./module-05-collaboration/collaboration_overview.md)  

### Extended CAA Concerns
6. [Observability Bus](./module-06-observability/observability_overview.md)  
7. [Security – A First-Class Architectural Layer](./module-07-security/security_overview.md)  

### Lifecycle & Meta
8. [Learning & Adaptation](./module-08-learning/learning_overview.md)
9. [Scaling, Performance & ROI](./module-09-scale/scale_overview.md)

---

## 🔹 How It Works
- **Modules** contain: overviews, patterns, anti-patterns, RFCs, and case study notes.  
- **Case Studies** from Nexus sessions are anonymized, summarized, and mapped to modules.  
- **RFCs** allow the community to propose, refine, and ratify design patterns.  

---

## 🔹 Relationship to CAA
- The formal **CAA specification** lives in its [own repository](https://github.com/cognitive-agentic-architecture).  
- The Blueprint is the **curriculum and knowledge base** that applies CAA in practice.  
- Over time, validated case studies and patterns here may feed back into the CAA spec itself.

## 🔹 Guiding Principle
> “The era of AI demos is over.  
> The Blueprint is where we turn CAA into practice —  
> transforming hacks into systems, and prototypes into production.”
