## 🔹 Decision-Making

- **Lazy Consensus:**  
  Proposals (via Issues or PRs) are accepted if there are no objections after **7 days**.  
  Maintainers may merge earlier if there is clear consensus.

- **Escalation:**  
  If there is a disagreement, maintainers discuss in a dedicated thread.  
  Organizers make the final decision if needed.

- **Voting:**  
  Topic prioritization and session planning are driven by 👍 reactions on Issues.

## 🔹 Content Review Process

1. **Submit:** All contributions start as Issues (topic requests, case studies, RFCs).  
2. **Triage:** Maintainers label, assign reviewers, and request additional info if needed.  
3. **PR Creation:** Contributor or maintainer drafts a PR referencing the Issue.  
4. **Review:** Maintainers review for clarity, quality, and confidentiality.  
5. **Merge & Publish:** Once approved, PR is merged and Issue is closed.

## 🔹 Confidentiality Rules

- Contributors are responsible for **redacting sensitive details** before submission.  
- Case studies can be anonymized (remove org names, sensitive diagrams).  
- Some content may only be published as **summaries** if requested.  
- Proprietary or internal-use material is **never merged without explicit approval**.
